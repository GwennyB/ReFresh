# Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Exposure
SQL injection is a type of attack that inserts, deletes, or modifies data in a database by submitting form inputs containing SQL commands.  

SQL injection would have put our Products and User databases at risk of manipulation, which could result in changes to the products content, and also put users' sensitive information (ie - identification, credit card numbers, etc) at risk of disclosure.  

Repair
The use of dependency injection (ie - repository design pattern) and the proven 'Identity' library from Microsoft effectively contained the vulnerability. Using a proxy context in place of a direct database context makes it possible to sterilize inputs by expected vs actual datatype before they're introduced to the database.  

Examples:
IAuthorizeNetManager.cs + AuthorizeNetService.cs  
ICartManager.cs + CartManagementService.cs  
IInventoryManager.cs + InventorymanagementService.cs  
ISearchBarManager.cs + SearchBarManagementService.cs  


# Vulnerability: Improper Access
Exposure
Open access to all webpage resources enables exploitation of site data and controls to any user.  

Open access would have put both our databases at risk by allowing any user access to the administrative functions, which include assignment of new administrators and full CRUD of products. User data would not have been directly at risk.  

Repair
This webpage makes use of policy-based access restrictions (ie - Authorization) to limit access of critical functions to those who've been assigned to the Admin role.  

Example:  
~/Pages/Admin/Index.cshtml.cs  (entire class restricted by '[Authorize("AdminOnly")]')
